}
\arguments{
\item{env_df}{Dataframe (wide) of environmental variables per sitecol.}

\item{methods_df}{Dataframe. What methods to use to create clusters.}

\item{taxa_col}{Character. Name of column with taxa.}

\item{num_col}{Character. Name of column with numeric data indicating
relative abundance of taxa.}

\item{groups}{Numeric vector indicating the range of groups within a
clustering.}

\item{df}{Dataframe. Needs the 'cols' outlined below.}

\item{site_col}{Chracter. Name of column with 'site'.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with groups and methods columns and a list column of the
clustering for that number of groups and method as a tibble with one column
(numeric) 'clust' indicating group membership.
